  <h3>Who I Am</h3>
  <p>
    I am an experienced iOS developer who has more than 9 years of professional experience. I started coding when I was 12 years old. My first coding experience was with PHP. Just like everyone else, my first print statement was “Hello world!” Ever since my first “hello”, I never intended to say goodbye to the coding world as it is more than half of my life. Of course, I earn my living from coding—I pay my bills, my rent, and live thanks to it—but to me, it’s way more than just a job. I code or read about it before and after work, and I’ve even found myself fixing bugs in my head while trying to fall asleep. If you're reading this book, you're in good hands. I’ll do my best to share with you everything I’ve learned over the years.
    
    <br><br>Feel free to follow me on social media—I share bite-sized videos there where I teach coding in a more visual, hands-on way. I’m also working on a full video course that will take you from absolute beginner to iOS developer. It’s not far from release, so if you want to be notified when it goes live, don’t forget to follow. All the details are coming up in the next page.
  </p>
<br><br>
  <h3>My Mission</h3>
  <p>
    My mission is simple but powerful: to help people like you—curious, driven, and ready to learn—become confident iOS developers. I don’t just want to throw theory at you; I want to teach in a way that actually sticks. That means sharing not only the how but also the why behind every concept, using real-world examples, and breaking down even the most intimidating topics into something clear and manageable.
    
    <br><br>I believe learning should be accessible, honest, and practical. That’s why I create resources—books, tutorials, videos—that focus on real development skills. I want to teach you how to build apps that actually work, how to write code you’ll be proud of, and how to keep growing even after you’ve landed your first job. I also believe in giving back to the community through open source, mentorship, and by being honest about the ups and downs of this journey.

    <br><br>Whether you're building your first “Hello World” or publishing your tenth app to the App Store, I want to be part of your path. Let’s build cool things—and better futures—together.
